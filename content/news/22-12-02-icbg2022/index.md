Just approaching the end of the year, we had the opportunity to present our work in #ICGB2022.

[The Irish Computational Biology and Genomics Symposium](https://icbgsymposium.com) is an annual event led by students that bring together PhD students and experts in the fields of bioinformatics. This year's symposium took place on December 1-2, 2022, at Aula Maxima, University of Galway. 

The symposium aims to provide a platform for researchers to present their latest findings and discuss the most recent developments in computational biology. The symposium also allows post-graduate students to network and collaborate with experts in their research fields.

Likewise previous years, our group joined the symposium. [Swathi]({{< relref "/authors/swathi" >}}) and [Cosmin]({{< relref "/authors/cosmin" >}}) gave a short talk, and [Narod]({{< relref "/authors/narod" >}}) presented a poster. This was a great opportunity for attendees to learn about our research and to engage with us directly.
