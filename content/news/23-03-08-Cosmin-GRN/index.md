Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are widely used to understand how driver mutations in tumours alter transcriptional networks and to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we use genome-wide CRISPR screen data to systematically evaluate the ability of GRNs to predict sensitivity to genetic perturbation in cancer. <!--more-->

Spoiler alert â€“ we find that, for the purposes of predicting gene inhibition sensitivity, simple mRNA abundance generally outperforms gene regulatory activity inferred from GRNs!
