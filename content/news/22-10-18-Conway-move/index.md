After some happy and productive years at [Systems Biology Ireland](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/) we have moved to the adjacent [Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/)
<!--more-->

The Conway is an interdisciplinary research institute with members from multiple Schools in UCD, we're the first from the School of Computer Science. The institute houses much of UCD's 'omics' facilities, including the [Genomics Core](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/research/coretechnologies/genomicscore/) and [Proteomics Core](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/research/coretechnologies/proteomicscore-massspectrometryresource/) along with many [research groups](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/research/researchers/conwayfellowsa-z/) doing basic and applied biology research. It's a nice place to be and we have room for more members if you're [interested in joining](/vacancies).

We joined in time for this year's [Conway Festival of Research](https://www.flickr.com/photos/51341109@N02/) where [Anjan]({{< relref "/authors/anjan" >}}) and [Narod]({{< relref "/authors/narod" >}}) both presented posters that received commendations and [Thomas]({{< relref "/authors/thomas" >}}) presented at the moderated poster session.
