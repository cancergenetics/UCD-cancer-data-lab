Everyone knows that there is an imperfect correlation between mRNA and protein abundances. In Swathi's recent paper we analysed how much measurement (ir)reproducibility contributes to this. <!--more-->
We found that some proteins are more reproducibly quantified than others and that in general reproducibly quantified proteins tend to have higher mRNA-protein correlations. Overall variation in measurement reproducibility accounts for a substantial fraction of the unexplained variation between mRNA and protein abundances. You can read the full paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100288). 

As part of the work we have put together an [aggregated protein reproducibility score](https://github.com/cancergenetics/limitations_of_omics_reproducibility/blob/main/local_data/results/TableS2.xlsx?raw=true) that we think will be useful for prioritising proteins whose abundance can be reproducibility quantified.

Swathi has also put together a short video presentation of the work for JRNcLub [here](https://jrnlclub.org/research-films/mrna-protein-reproducibility).
