The lab was well represented at the [Conway Festival of Research 2024](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/education/seminarsevents/2024ucdconwayfestivalofresearchinnovation/). Colm gave an invite lectured,  Cosmin was a runner up in the Gold Medal competition for his [NAR Cancer paper](https://academic.oup.com/narcancer/article/5/4/zcad056/7453243) and Narod, Metin, Olivier and Hamda all presented posters. We didn't take enough photos, but managed to capture Metin and Olivier in action.
