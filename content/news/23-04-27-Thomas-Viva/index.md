Congratulations to Dr. Thomas Lefeivre, who successfully defended his thesis 'Investigation of the functional interplay between signalling pathways and epigenetic factors in acute leukaemia' on April 18th.<!--more-->

Thomas has been a member of the [Bond](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/team/groups/bondgroup/) and Ryan groups since 2018. We're lucky to have Thomas stay on with us temporarily, experimentally some testing some new synthetic lethals and performing proteomic profiling of cancer cell lines. 

Many thanks to the external examiner, [Dr. David O'Connor](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=DKOCO07), and internal examiner, [Assoc. Prof. Rory Johnson](https://www.gold-lab.org/). Thanks also to [Dr. Melinda Halasz](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/team/groups/halaszgroup/) for chairing the viva and making sure everything ran smoothly.
