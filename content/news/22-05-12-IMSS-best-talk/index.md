Due to the pandemic, this was Swathi’s first in person conference presentation, so winning a prize for her talk was a huge achievement. Swathi’s talk was titled ‘Experimental reproducibility limits the correlation between mRNA and protein abundances in tumour proteomic profiles’, you can read more about the work in the associated preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.22.461108v2).
