Congratulations to Dr. Anjan Venkatesh, who successfully defended his thesis 'A systematic study of paralog and protein complex response to gene loss in cancer' on February 14th (:cupid:).<!--more-->

Anjan has been a member of the group since 2020, joining us from the excellent [SFI Centre for Research Training in Genomics Data Science](https://genomicsdatascience.ie/). Prior to joining our lab, Anjan worked with [Prof. Ken Wolfe](http://wolfe.ucd.ie/) (perhaps surprisinglym not on paralogs!). You can read the first part of Anjan's thesis on [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.26.615228v1). The second part is still in the oven. 

Many thanks to the external examiner, [Prof. Pedro Beltrao](https://imsb.ethz.ch/research/beltrao.html), and internal examiner, [Prof. Denis Shields](https://people.ucd.ie/denis.shields). Thanks also to [Dr. Dimitris Chatzopoulos](https://people.ucd.ie/dimitris.chatzopoulos) for chairing the viva and making sure everything ran smoothly.
