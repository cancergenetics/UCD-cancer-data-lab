Congratulations to Dr. Barbara De Kegel, who passed her viva with flying colours this week.

Barbara’s thesis ‘The contribution of paralog buffering to tumor robustness’ was accepted with no corrections. Barbara’s thesis contained the results from two published papers and a preprint.

Many thanks to the external examiner, Prof. Christian Landry, and internal examiner, Assoc. Prof. Gianluca Pollastri. Thanks also to Prof. Barry Smyth for chairing the viva and making sure everything ran smoothly.

As Barbara is already working in the US, we had to congratulate her via Zoom!
