The Spetses Summer School 2022 on Cancer Epigenetics took place from 28 August to 3 September. More than 100 participants joined the event full of excellent talks, posters, and breakout sessions. We are thrilled to share that Thomas's work on acute leukaemia was selected out of other posters for a talk.
