  Tumour cells tolerate enormous numbers of genetic perturbations, including loss-of-function mutations and homozygous deletions of entire protein-coding genes. Despite these perturbations, tumour cells continue to function and indeed thrive. This ability of cells and organisms to tolerate genetic perturbations is generally called genetic robustness. In model organisms, paralogs (duplicate genes) have been shown to be crucial to genetic robustness. Because they are derived from the same ancestral gene, paralogs often share significant sequence similarity and in some cases functional similarity. Pairs of paralogs can therefore often compensate for each others’ loss, allowing one member of the paralog pair to be mutated or deleted with relatively little fitness consequence. We are interested in understanding how these compensatory relationships between paralogs shape tumour genome evolution, how they impact the vulnerabilities of cancer cell lines, and how they facilitate the rewiring of molecular interaction networks in cancer. There is a connection here to our work on synthetic lethality – compensatory relationships between paralogs are often revealed by synthetic lethal interactions and so we have developed an approach to systematically predict synthetic lethality between paralogs.</p>
