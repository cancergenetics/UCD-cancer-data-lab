## Network rewiring in response to genetic perturbations in cancer

<img src="NetworkEffects.png" style="margin:15px; width:100%; height:50%; align:center"/>

Genes, and their protein products, work in dense interconnected networks. A consequence of this is that the mutation of one gene in cancer often propagates through molecular interaction networks. For instance, the mutation of one member of a protein complex can result in altered protein abundance of the [entire protein complex](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2017.09.011). Likewise, the mutation of a transcription factor can result in the altered expression of many of that transcription factorâ€™s targets. We are interested in developing integrative approaches to model and predict these downstream effects of mutations in cancer.
