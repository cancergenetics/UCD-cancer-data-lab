Genes, and their protein products, work in dense interconnected networks. A consequence of this is that the mutation of one gene in cancer often propagates through molecular interaction networks. For instance, the mutation of one member of a protein complex can result in altered protein abundance of the [entire protein complex](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(17)30399-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS240547121730399X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue). Likewise, the mutation of a transcription factor can result in the altered expression of many of that transcription factorâ€™s targets. We are interested in developing integrative approaches to model and predict these downstream effects of mutations in cancer.
