  Genes, and their protein products, work in dense interconnected networks. A consequence of this is that the mutation of one gene in cancer often propagates through molecular interaction networks. For instance, the mutation of one member of a protein complex can result in altered protein abundance of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2017.09.011">entire protein complex</a>. Likewise, the mutation of a transcription factor can result in the altered expression of many of that transcription factorâ€™s targets. We are interested in developing integrative approaches to model and predict these downstream effects of mutations in cancer.</p>
