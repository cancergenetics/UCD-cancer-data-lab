abstract: "Traditional genetic interaction screens profile phenotypes at aggregate level, missing interactions that may influence the distribution of single cells in specific states. Here, Heigwer and colleagues use an imaging approach to generate a large-scale high-resolution genetic interaction map in Drosophila cells and demonstrate its utility for understanding gene function."
