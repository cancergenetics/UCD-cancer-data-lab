abstract: "The *RB1* tumor suppressor is recurrently mutated in a variety of cancers including retinoblastomas, small cell lung cancers, triple-negative breast cancers, prostate cancers, and osteosarcomas. Finding new synthetic lethal (SL) interactions with *RB1* could lead to new approaches to treating cancers with inactivated *RB1*. We identified 95 SL partners of *RB1* based on a *Drosophila* screen for genetic modifiers of the eye phenotype caused by defects in the *RB1* ortholog, *Rbf1*. We validated 38 mammalian orthologs of *Rbf1* modifiers as RB1 SL partners in human cancer cell lines with defective *RB1* alleles. We further show that for many of the *RB1* SL genes validated in human cancer cell lines, low activity of the SL gene in human tumors, when concurrent with low levels of *RB1* was associated with improved patient survival. We investigated higher order combinatorial gene interactions by creating a novel *Drosophila* cancer model with co-occurring *Rbf1, Pten* and *Ras* mutations, and found that targeting *RB1* SL genes in this background suppressed the dramatic tumor growth and rescued fly survival whilst having minimal effects on wild-type cells. Finally, we found that drugs targeting the identified RB1 interacting genes/pathways, such as UNC3230, PYR-41, TAK-243, isoginkgetin, madrasin, and celastrol also elicit SL in human cancer cell lines. In summary, we identified several high confidence, evolutionarily conserved, novel targets for *RB1*-deficient cells that may be further adapted for the treatment of human cancer."
