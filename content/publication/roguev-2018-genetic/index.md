abstract: "This protocol describes computational analysis of genetic interaction screens, ranging from data capture (plate imaging) to downstream analyses. Plate imaging approaches using both digital camera and office flatbed scanners are included, along with a protocol for the extraction of colony size measurements from the resulting images. A commonly used genetic interaction scoring method, calculation of the S-score, is discussed. These methods require minimal computer skills, but some familiarity with MATLAB and Linux/Unix is a plus. Finally, an outline for using clustering and visualization software for analysis of resulting data sets is provided."
