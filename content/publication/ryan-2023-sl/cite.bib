abstract = {The concept of synthetic lethality has been widely applied to identify therapeutic targets in cancer, with varying degrees of success. The standard approach normally involves identifying genetic interactions between two genes, a driver and a target. In reality, however, most cancer synthetic lethal effects are likely complex and also polygenic, being influenced by the environment in addition to involving contributions from multiple genes. By acknowledging and delineating this complexity, we describe in this article how the success rate in cancer drug discovery and development could be improved.}
