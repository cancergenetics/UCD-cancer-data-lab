abstract: "Protein complexes are responsible for the bulk of activities within the cell, but how their behavior and abundance varies across tumors remains poorly understood. By combining proteomic profiles of breast tumors with a large-scale protein-protein interaction network, we have identified a set of 285 high-confidence protein complexes whose subunits have highly correlated protein abundance across tumor samples. We used this set to identify com- plexes that are reproducibly under- or overexpressed in specific breast cancer subtypes. We found that mutation or deletion of one subunit of a co-regulated complex was often associated with a collateral reduction in protein expression of additional complex members. This collateral loss phenomenon was typi- cally evident from proteomic, but not transcriptomic, profiles, suggesting post-transcriptional control. Mu- tation of the tumor suppressor E-cadherin (*CDH1*) was associated with a collateral loss of members of the adherens junction complex, an effect we vali- dated using an engineered model of E-cadherin loss."
