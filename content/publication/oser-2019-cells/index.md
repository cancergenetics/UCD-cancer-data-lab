abstract: "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancers and is almost always linked to inactivating *RB1* and *TP53* mutations. SCLC frequently responds, albeit briefly, to chemotherapy. The canonical function of the *RB1* gene product RB1 is to repress the E2F transcription factor family. RB1 also plays both E2F-dependent and E2F-independent mitotic roles. We performed a synthetic lethal CRISPR/Cas9 screen in an *RB1−/−* SCLC cell line that conditionally expresses RB1 to identify dependencies that are caused by RB1 loss and discovered that *RB1−/−* SCLC cell lines are hyperdependent on multiple proteins linked to chromosomal segregation, including Aurora B kinase. Moreover, we show that an Aurora B kinase inhibitor is efficacious in multiple preclinical SCLC models at concentrations that are well tolerated in mice. These results suggest that RB1 loss is a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to Aurora B kinase inhibitors in SCLC and perhaps other *RB1−/−* cancers."
