We are a supportive and collaborative interdisciplinary research group based in the [Conway Institute](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/) and associated with the [School of Computer Science](https://www.ucd.ie/cs/) in University College Dublin. We are broadly interested in understanding how mutations in cancer alter molecular interaction networks and in identifying ways to target these alterations therapeutically. You can read more about our research interests [here](https://cancerdata.ucd.ie/research/). We do not have any vacancies currently, but we are happy to support fellowship applications.


## Fellowship Support

We are always interested in supporting applications for fellowships from applicants with an interest in our research. If you are interested in joining the lab, please send [Colm]({{< relref "/authors/colm" >}}) an email with details of your research interests.

For postdoctoral candidates, it's worth investigating following schemes:
- [Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://research.ie/funding-category/postdoctoral/)
- EU funded [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)

For PhD students:
- Irish Research Council typically have an [annual funding call](https://research.ie/funding-category/postgraduate/)
- Additionally, UCD School of Computer Science have [regular calls for PhD Scholarships](https://www.ucd.ie/cs/phdvacancies/ucdschoolofcomputersciencephdscholarships2022round2/). The UCD School of Computer Science PhD fellowships are only suitable for those with strong computational / data science skills, while other fellowships are open to those from different academic backgrounds (e.g. those with a primary degree in biology).
