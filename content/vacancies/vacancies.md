The UCD Cancer Data lab are currently looking to recruit computational biology postdocs. We are a supportive and collaborative interdisciplinary research group based in the [Conway Institute](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/) in University College Dublin. We are broadly interested in understanding how mutations in cancer alter molecular interaction networks and in identifying ways to target these alterations therapeutically. We have a particular interest in identifying and and understanding synthetic lethal interactions in cancer. You can read more about areas of specific research interest [here](https://cancerdata.ucd.ie/research/). 

The ideal candidate for these roles will have good programming and analytics skills and prior experience in the use of data-integration approaches to understand biology. Prior experience of cancer biology or genetic interactions is a plus, but certainly not a prerequisite for the roles. 

A formal job advertisement will follow on the [UCD vacancies site](https://www.ucd.ie/workatucd/jobs/). If you are interested in applying, please send a CV and brief letter of motivation to colm.ryan@ucd.ie.

## Fellowship Support

We are always interested in supporting applications for fellowships from applicants with an interest in our research. If you are interested in joining the lab, please send [Colm]({{< relref "/authors/colm" >}}) an email with details of your research interests.

For postdoctoral candidates, it's worth investigating following schemes:
- [Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://research.ie/funding-category/postdoctoral/)
- EU funded [Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)

For PhD students:
- Irish Research Council typically have an [annual funding call](https://research.ie/funding-category/postgraduate/)
- Additionally, UCD School of Computer Science have [regular calls for PhD Scholarships](https://www.ucd.ie/cs/phdvacancies/ucdschoolofcomputersciencephdscholarships2022round2/). The UCD School of Computer Science PhD fellowships are only suitable for those with strong computational / data science skills, while other fellowships are open to those from different academic backgrounds (e.g. those with a primary degree in biology).
