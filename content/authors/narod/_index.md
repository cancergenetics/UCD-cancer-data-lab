Narod received her BSc in Genetics and Bioengineering from Istanbul Bilgi University, Turkey and MSc in Biostatistics and Bioinformatics from Acibadem MAA University, Turkey. During her graduate studies, she worked in a UK-based biotechnology company that equipped her with three years of extensive research experience ranging from wet-lab experiments to computational drug discovery pipelines. As a part of an academic institution and an industrial company throughout her MSc study, she has garnered many essential skills that drive her to pursue a Ph.D. study at University College Dublin. Her research areas of interest are cancer, synthetic lethality, and machine learning.
