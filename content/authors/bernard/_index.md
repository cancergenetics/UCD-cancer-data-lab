Bernard obtained his B.Sc. in Bioinformatics from the Indonesia International Institute for Life Sciences (i3L) at Jakarta, Indonesia. He originally developed interest in cancer genomics. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic and in his final year, he worked on the bioinformatics pipelines for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 as his thesis. This led him to join GSI Lab and assist the COVID-19 genomic surveillance in Indonesia for nearly a year before moving to Ireland to pursue his PhD. He is supervised by [Prof. Corrado Santocanale](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/our-research/people/biological-chemical-sciences/corradosantocanale/) in the [Centre for Chromosome Biology](https://www.chromosome.ie/), University of Galway and also co-supervised by Dr. Colm J. Ryan in the Conway Institute, UCD. His project focuses on the functional genomics analysis of potential drug candidates for cancer therapy using the combination of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen and a next-generation sequencing approach.
