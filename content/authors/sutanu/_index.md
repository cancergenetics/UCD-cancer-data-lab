Sutanu is a DevelopMed Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow working with Dr. Ryan's Group at System Biology Ireland, University College Dublin, Ireland. By training, he is a computer scientist. He did his undergrad and master's degree in Computer Science. Next, he joined as a DST Inspire fellow at CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory in India to pursue his Ph.D. As a part of his doctoral research, he has had the opportunity to learn various machine learning algorithms and develop strategies for predicting essential genes. His research uses multidisciplinary knowledge from systems biology, computational biology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to understand complex biological problems. His present study involves developing a machine learning framework to decipher and predict context-specific synthetic lethality in cancer.
