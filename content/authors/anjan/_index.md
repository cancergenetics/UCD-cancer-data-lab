Anjan obtained his BSc Hons. in Genetics from University College Dublin in 2019. Following this, he worked as a research assistant in Prof. Ken Wolfe's group in the UCD Conway Institute, studying protein secretion and gene cluster evolution in yeast. Anjan is currently undertaking a PhD in Prof. Colm Ryan's group in Systems Biology Ireland, UCD, studying the differential assembly of protein complexes in cancer cells. He is funded by the Science Foundation Ireland Center for Research Training in Genomics Data Science. He uses data science and machine learning methods to glean biological insights from multi-omics datasets such as the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) studies. His research interests include cancer biology, systems biology, proteomics, and data science.
