The UCD Cancer Data Lab, led by [Dr. Colm J. Ryan]({{< relref "/authors/admin" >}}), use large-scale data analysis to understand how genetic variation in cancer alters molecular interaction networks and to identify ways to target these alterations therapeutically.

Our group is embedded within the Department of Computer Science of the Univeristy College Dublin and a member of the [UCD Conway Institute](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/), [Systems Biology Ireland](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/), and the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Genomics Data Science](https://genomicsdatascience.ie).
